# Health Insurance Costs Prediction


## Overview



## Resources Used
- Python 3.7
- Numpy and Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- scipy.stats for feature scaling
- sklearn for train_test_split data, building and evaluating the regression models


## Dataset
The Insurance dataset has 1338 observations and 7 attributes and contains medical personal costs billed by a health insurance company:

- age: Age of primary beneficiary
- sex: Insurance contractor gender, female, male
- bmi: Body Mass Index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height, objective index of body weight (kg/m^2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9
- children: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents
- smoker: Smoking
- region: The beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.
